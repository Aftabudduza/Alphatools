        <p>During this time of  unprecedented uncertainty, all of us here at Alpha® are concerned  about the safety and well-being of our families, colleagues, customers,  partners, and the many friends who make up our global family.<br />
          Our hearts are with those who have been  affected personally by the outbreak of coronavirus (COVID-19) as well as the  many communities around the world that are facing extreme measures in the  attempt to slow its spread.</p>
          <p>We are  taking actions to safeguard the health of our employees and preserve our  ability to operate. We have identified areas which we consider critical to  operate and have implemented plans to ensure we have enough staff to operate  safely and ship products to our customers. </p>
        <p>Unfortunately,  it has become necessary to place some of our  employees on a temporary furlough. Our management team and staff&nbsp;on hand will continue  working to make certain our operations continue to run efficiently to  assist our customers.</p>
       <p>As you  may be aware, the entire global supply chain has been impacted due to the  COVID-19 outbreak, which has led to some disruptions  in shipping services. We currently have sufficient  inventory of product and parts but are asking customers to provide additional  lead time going forward.</p>
       <p>Best wishes for safety and good health to all.</p>

<p>  We are monitoring the  latest developments and following the appropriate recommendations by the  authorities. &nbsp;Our goal is to keep our employees and their families safe  while continuing to service our customers.

<p>                        Communication with our customers is very important to us.&nbsp;  Although this has not been finalized yet, due to the continuous spread of the  coronavirus there may be a mandatory shut down of all businesses in Bergen  County, NJ which is home to Alpha Professional Tools®. &nbsp;This may include  our supply chain and delivery of goods.</p>
                        <p>
                          As stated yesterday, we will continue to keep our facility open  as long as possible and will have sales and customer service representatives  available by phone, Skype, e-mail, or text to answer your questions.&nbsp; If it  becomes mandated to close our facility, we will have employees working remotely  to service your account.</p>
                        <p>
                        In the meantime, please review any product needs you may have  and if needed, send your <a href="mailto:orderdesk@alpha-tools.com">orders</a> in ASAP as there is a tentative shutdown scheduled for end of day Friday, 3/20/20.&nbsp;  We will do our very best to ship your order.</p>

<p>As the situation with the coronavirus (COVID-19) continues to evolve, Alpha® is continuing business as usual and working to minimize any disruptions. Nothing is more important than the health and safety of our employees, customers, partners and the community. We are taking steps to minimize those risks as recommended by the CDC.</p>
<p>Our plan is to continue to keep our facility open and operating, and will make modifications in our day-to-day business operations as needed. Although we prefer to meet in person, the use of technology allows us to work remotely and virtual meetings are as effective.</p>
