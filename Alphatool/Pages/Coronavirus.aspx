        <p><strong>April 15, 2020</strong></p>
        <p>During this time of  unprecedented uncertainty, all of us here at Alpha® are concerned  about the safety and well-being of our families, colleagues, customers,  partners, and the many friends who make up our global family.<br />
          Our hearts are with those who have been  affected personally by the outbreak of coronavirus (COVID-19) as well as the  many communities around the world that are facing extreme measures in the  attempt to slow its spread.</p>
          <p>We are  taking actions to safeguard the health of our employees and preserve our  ability to operate. We have identified areas which we consider critical to  operate and have implemented plans to ensure we have enough staff to operate  safely and ship products to our customers. </p>
        <p>Unfortunately,  it has become necessary to place some of our  employees on a temporary furlough. Our management team and staff&nbsp;on hand will continue  working to make certain our operations continue to run efficiently to  assist our customers.</p>
       <p>As you  may be aware, the entire global supply chain has been impacted due to the  COVID-19 outbreak, which has led to some disruptions  in shipping services. We currently have sufficient  inventory of product and parts but are asking customers to provide additional  lead time going forward.</p>
       <p>Best wishes for safety and good health to all.</p>

                        <p><strong>March 24, 2020</strong></p>
        <p>Our facility is open for business and we are processing orders  and repairing tools. We have sales, customer service and operations  representatives available by phone, Skype, e-mail, or text to answer your  questions and to maintain our daily operations.</p>
        <p>
                          In  addition, product and parts can still be ordered online directly from our  product pages.</p>
        <p>We are monitoring the latest developments and following the appropriate  recommendations by the authorities. Our goal is to keep our employees and their  families safe while continuing to service our customers. We appreciate your  patience and understanding during these unprecedented times. </p>

                        <p>To Our Customers and Friends,</p>
                        <p>As the situation with the coronavirus (COVID-19) continues to evolve, Alpha® is continuing business as usual and working to minimize any disruptions. Nothing is more important than the health and safety of our employees, customers, partners and the community. We are taking steps to minimize those risks as recommended by the CDC.</p>
                        <p>Our plan is to continue to keep our facility open and operating, and will make modifications in our day-to-day business operations as needed. Although we prefer to meet in person, the use of technology allows us to work remotely and virtual meetings are as effective.</p>
        <p>Alpha® prides itself on providing seamless customer service and responsiveness and will continue to do our best to ship products promptly. Our Sales, Customer Service and Technical staff are available to you. You may also visit our website for product information and other details.<br />
                          As new developments emerge regarding the coronavirus, we will share our company directives and continue to operate safely and effectively. </p>
        <p>Thank you for your business and we hope you and your family are all well. Please reach out to us if you have any questions or concerns.</p>
